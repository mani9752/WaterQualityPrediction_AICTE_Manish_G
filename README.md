# WaterQualityPrediction_AICTE_Manish_G
AICTE internship shell - AI intern - Water Quality Prediction
🌊 Project Overview
This project predicts the concentration levels of six major water pollutants based on the selected year and station ID. It uses a machine learning model (MultiOutputRegressor with RandomForest) trained on water quality data provided by AICTE.

🔍 Objectives

Build a prediction model for six pollutants: O₂, NO₃, NO₂, SO₄, PO₄, and Cl

Use multi-output regression to predict all pollutant levels at once

Provide an interactive UI using Streamlit

Simplify water quality forecasting for real-world users

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

Python, Pandas, NumPy – Data processing

Scikit-learn – Machine Learning modeling

Joblib – Model saving and loading

Streamlit – Interactive web app
